<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack mobile exercise timer app using Expo, React Native, FastAPI, and MongoDB, iterating closely with user feedback. The development trajectory shows a clear path from initial requirements (timer, animations, settings) to advanced features (audio cues, skip button, custom GIF integrations) and complex deployment guidance. The AI demonstrated strong troubleshooting capabilities, especially in resolving React 19 incompatibility, Expo Web rendering issues, and Google Play Store upload errors (version code, advertising ID). Key decisions included adopting local storage for production robustness and leveraging  for cross-platform sound. The engineer diligently addressed all explicit user requests, providing comprehensive solutions, build commands, and detailed publishing instructions, ensuring the app is production-ready and fully branded.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a simple mobile exercise timing app with a countdown (40s work, 20s rest), small matchstick video animations, and settings for exercise sets, circuits, and custom time intervals.
Expanded requirements included:
- Simple animated stick figures for push-ups, squats, jumping jacks, and mountain climbers.
- Customizable number of sets per exercise, total circuits, work/rest time intervals.
- Exercise selection toggles and flow management.
- Audio cues (sound queue) for the last 3 seconds of work/rest intervals.
- Replacement of stick figure animations with user-provided videos/GIFs for specific exercises, eventually for all exercises (push-ups, squats, jumping jacks, mountain climbers).
- UI shrinkage to accommodate an ad area.
- A skip button next to the pause button to advance stages (rest -> exercise, exercise -> rest).
- Publishing guidance for Google Play Store, including app configuration and issue resolution (e.g., AAB upload errors, sound/settings not saving on production). The app was named Simple HIIT.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Expo/React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development.
- **Expo Router**: File-based navigation.
- **FastAPI/MongoDB**: Backend for exercise/settings persistence.
- **React Native Reanimated/SVG**: Animations, stick figures.
- **//**: Video/audio playback and generation.
- **AsyncStorage**: Local device storage for settings (production fallback).
- **EAS CLI/Expo CLI**: Tools for building and publishing Expo applications.
- **Flexbox**: UI layout.
- **Platform.OS**: Cross-platform code branching.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/frontend/app/index.tsx**:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main timer screen, the core of the application. It displays the current exercise, timer, progress, and controls.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained basic UI and timer logic. Significantly updated to integrate with the backend API (later replaced by AsyncStorage for settings), implement animated stick figures, then custom GIFs, add sound cues (, then ), implement haptic feedback, integrate a skip button, and adjust styling for vertical UI compression and an ad area. Also includes logic for loading state, exercise progression, and managing app-wide settings.
-   **/app/frontend/app/settings.tsx**:
    -   **Importance**: Provides a dedicated screen for users to customize workout parameters like work/rest times, sets, circuits, and active exercises.
    -   **Changes**: Created as a new route. Implemented form inputs and logic for updating workout settings. Initially used backend API for persistence; later switched to  for local, offline-first persistence.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend providing API endpoints for managing exercises and storing user workout settings.
    -   **Changes**: Initial implementation included CRUD operations for exercises and user settings, using MongoDB. Although initially integrated with the frontend, the frontend eventually moved to local storage for settings for production robustness, but the backend remains fully functional.
-   **/app/frontend/app.json**:
    -   **Importance**: Central configuration file for the Expo application, defining app name, icons, permissions, plugins, and platform-specific settings for building.
    -   **Changes**: Updated for store submission (Simple HIIT), included bundle identifiers, splash screen references, target SDK versions, and various plugins (, , , , , , ). Crucially, the  array was corrected to include web to fix web rendering issues, and  and  were incremented for subsequent AAB uploads.
-   **/app/frontend/eas.json**:
    -   **Importance**: Configuration for Expo Application Services (EAS) builds, specifying build profiles (e.g., ) and platform targets.
    -   **Changes**: Created to define EAS build settings for Android. Updated to ensure production builds are properly configured and includes  for Play Store uploads.
-   **/app/frontend/assets/**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all static assets like images, icons, and custom GIFs.
    -   **Changes**: Added , , , and  as user-provided animations to replace stick figures.
-   **/app/frontend/store-assets/**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains documents required for app store submission.
    -   **Changes**: Created  and  to assist with Google Play Store submission.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- The user has not yet re-uploaded the latest AAB to Google Play Store with the version code and advertising ID fixes.
- The user needs to complete the Advertising ID declaration in the Google Play Console, explicitly stating that the app does not collect advertising IDs.
- User needs to take and upload app icon (512x512px), feature graphic (1024x500px), and at least two phone screenshots.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues reported by the user after a test application upload to Google Play Store:
1.  **Version code 1 has already been used. Try another version code.**
2.  **You must complete the advertising ID declaration...**

The AI addressed these by:
-   **Updating Version Code**: Modified  to increment  from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 and  from 1 to 2. It also updated  to 2.
    
-   **Ad ID Declaration**: Instructed the user on how to declare that the app *does not collect* advertising IDs within the Google Play Console settings, and also added  to  as a best practice for future ad integration.

The app currently features:
-   All 4 exercises with user-provided balloon character GIFs.
-   40s work / 20s rest timer with audio beeps and haptic feedback for the last 3 seconds.
-   Local saving of settings via  for offline functionality.
-   A skip button for immediate progression through workout stages.
-   A compact UI with a designated ad area.
-   A comprehensive set of features and configurations ready for Google Play Store.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to await user confirmation that the AAB upload was successful and that the app now saves settings and plays sounds correctly on their device.
